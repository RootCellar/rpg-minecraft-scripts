# RPG Minecraft Skript
---

A collection of server-side scripts intended to add RPG elements such as
classes and magic to Vanilla Minecraft server gameplay.

Skript is a server plugin that makes it much easier to write server-side code
for Minecraft servers. The plugin parses the code (the `.sk` files) and
executes their contents.

Incomplete list of features to give you an idea of what the scripts have and can do:

- Classes
  - Warrior
  - Rogue
  - Wizard
  - Paladin
  - Necromancer (with working minions!)
  - Cleric
  - Herobrine
- Magic
  - Spells
    - Fireball
    - Cryoball
    - Lightning
  - Cleric Prayers and Divine Channeling
- Custom Effects on Mobs
- Custom World Effects

- Various utility functions to support these features, such as:
  - Feature flags, to enable and disable features on the fly
  - Debug logging functions, where each type can be enabled and disabled on the fly
